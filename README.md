# Crime Distribution in Chicago

This project focuses on predicting crime rates in various locations in Chicago, as well as optimizing the distribution of the police force for future crime prevention.

--

## Goals

1. Model the crime rate distribution in Chicago with a Bayesian model

2. Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo and optimization methods to fit parameters

3. Draw crime samples from the posterior distribution of the Bayesian model and determine optimal allocation and size of police departments given crime distribution.

## Dataset

Crime data directly from the Chicago Police Departmentâ€™s reporting system are available as part of the Chicago open data initiative [5]. The dataset contains reported incidents of crime in the City of Chicago on a daily basis from 2001 until present day (excluding the past week). For each of the more than 5.5 million samples, the crime type, time of day, and location are available.

## Files
